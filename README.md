The goal of this repository is to provide an insight of how I raise bugs in general and how I work.

This collection only has bugs of games that were part of public Beta Testing or were released prior to my work.
All other projects I am or have worked on are private and are only shared with the collaborators to secure the projects' confidentiality.
